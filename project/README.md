# Database Solution Comparison

Now we arrive at an intersection. We can either start using a Database as a Service (DBaaS) such as the Google Cloud SQL in our case or just use the PersistentVolumeClaims with our own Postgres images and let the Google Kubernetes Engine take care of storage via PersistentVolumes for us.

Both solutions are widely used.

## DBaaS vs DIY

### DBaaS (Google Cloud SQL)

#### Pros
- **Ease of Setup**: Minimal setup required. Google Cloud SQL provides a managed service that handles the database setup, configuration, and maintenance.
- **Maintenance**: Automated maintenance including updates, patches, and security fixes.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale up or down based on demand.
- **Backup**: Automated backups and point-in-time recovery options.
- **High Availability**: Built-in high availability and failover capabilities.

#### Cons
- **Cost**: Can be more expensive due to the managed service fees.
- **Control**: Limited control over the database configuration and underlying infrastructure.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Google Cloud Platform, which might be a concern for some organizations.

### DIY (PersistentVolumeClaims with Postgres on GKE)

#### Pros
- **Cost**: Potentially lower cost as it uses standard compute and storage resources.
- **Control**: Full control over the database configuration and underlying infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: Can customize the setup to meet specific needs and requirements.

#### Cons
- **Setup Complexity**: Requires more initial setup and configuration, including setting up the Kubernetes cluster, PersistentVolumes, and Postgres instances.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance required, including updates, patches, and security fixes.
- **Backup**: Need to implement and manage your own backup solutions.
- **High Availability**: Requires additional configuration and management to ensure high availability and failover capabilities.

| Feature                | DBaaS (Google Cloud SQL)                                | DIY (PersistentVolumeClaims with Postgres on GKE) |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**              | Minimal setup required                                  | More complex setup                                |
| **Maintenance**        | Automated maintenance                                   | Manual maintenance required                       |
| **Scalability**        | Easy to scale                                           | Requires manual scaling                           |
| **Backup**             | Automated backups and point-in-time recovery            | Need to implement and manage own backup solutions |
| **High Availability**  | Built-in high availability and failover                 | Requires additional configuration                 |
| **Cost**               | Higher due to managed service fees                      | Potentially lower, using standard compute/storage |
| **Control**            | Limited control over configuration                      | Full control over configuration                   |
| **Vendor Lock-in**     | Dependency on Google Cloud Platform                     | No vendor lock-in                                 |

### Conclusion

Choosing between DBaaS and DIY depends on your specific needs and priorities. If ease of setup, automated maintenance, and built-in high availability are critical, DBaaS like Google Cloud SQL may be the better option. However, if you require more control over the database configuration and are willing to manage the setup and maintenance, DIY with PersistentVolumeClaims on GKE could be more cost-effective and flexible.
